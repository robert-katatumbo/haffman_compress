When is it “New Year”?

Here’s what to say at midnight (and for the first couple weeks of January): Happy New Year!

You also say “New Year” with no possessive apostrophe-s when you’re talking about the year as a whole.
“New Year’s” refers to one night, one day, and one resolution (or a lot of resolutions—we don’t judge).
But “new year” usually comes up when people are talking generally about the year, often before it’s begun or when it’s still early in the year.
